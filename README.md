# checkoutPage

I created a checkout component that allows a user to choose a specific option and quantity and add it to their bag. They also have the option on adding it to their favorites. When a user adds a product to their bag, they will see a checkout modal with all of the information (total price, total quanity, option chosen) as well as a carousel of related items which are filtered by product type. A user then is able to click checkout. 

This checkoutPage and ProxyJen are the microservices I created. Beauty Cart is a web application item page that I worked with 2 other engineers on.
